# Cohesive

It means that object should have a small and well-defined purpose, and they should do as little as possible.
It should follow Unix command, that do only and only one thing and do it well.

#### End result

More reusable, more reliable, more useful software

# Coupling

It means how two or more object depends on each other. These dependency poses limitation on the software 
1. No software reuse
2. More rippling effect
3. Low level of abstraction

## Rule of thumb: 
Well-defined software will achieve high cohesion and low coupling.
